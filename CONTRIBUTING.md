## Contributing to Champion Select

### Conduct

Please, follow the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). Be respectful, even to
those that are disrespectful.

### Feedback

I would love to hear your opinions, discuss potential
improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. Please, join or start a new
conversation in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/abramz/champion-select/issues).

### Documentation

We need your help with improving documentation to the project. This might be the easiest way for
you to contribute, because you don't even need to clone the repo but can edit or create new `.md`
files right from GitHub website as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).

### Bugs & Feature Requests

Before opening an issue, please:

* Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/abramz/champion-select/issues) to make sure
  your issue hasnâ€™t already been reported.

### Pull Requests

Before you submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from your
forked repo, check that it meets these guidelines:

* If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of the same PR.
* Create a separate PR for each small feature or bug fix.
* [Squash](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5189560/squash-my-last-x-commits-together-using-git)
  your commits into one for each PR.
* Run `npm test` to make sure that your code style is OK and there are no any regression bugs. 

#### Style Guide

Our linter will catch most styling issues that may exist in your code. You can check the status
of your code styling by simply running: `npm run lint`

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about
something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you
in the right direction.
